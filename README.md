Welcome to gpguio
gpguio is a GUI tool for basic GPIO usage


What does gpguizero do?
As of the first commit, nothing.


What does it require?
Well, a working RPi device. That's it.
All dependencies are included in the .zip file
(Thanks to PyInstaller)


What is it supposed to do?
Get user inputs and pipe relevant python code to a file (script.py)


Planned functionality -
Basic LED control is a starter.
A side panel for actually viewing what script.py will do.
Other functions will be added when the planned ones are completed.
Let's not get too far ahead of ourselves here
