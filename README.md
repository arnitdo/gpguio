**Welcome to gpguio**

gpguio is a GUI tool for basic GPIO usage


_What does gpguizero do?_

As of the first commit, nothing.


_What hardware does it require?_

Well, a working RPi device. That's it.


_What is it supposed to do?_

Get user inputs and pipe relevant python code to a file (script.py)


**Planned functionality -**

Basic LED control is a starter.

A side panel for actually viewing what script.py will do.


Other functions will be added when the planned ones are completed.

Let's not get too far ahead of ourselves here
