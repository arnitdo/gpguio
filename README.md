Welcome to gpguio
gpguio is a GUI tool for basic GPIO usage


What does gpguizero do?
As of the first commit, nothing.


What hardware does it require?
Well, a working RPi device. That's it.


What is it supposed to do?
Get user inputs and pipe relevant python code to a file (script.py)


Planned functionality -
Basic LED control is a starter.
A side panel for actually viewing what script.py will do.
Other functions will be added when the planned ones are completed.
Let's not get too far ahead of ourselves here
